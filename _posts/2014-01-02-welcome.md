Hi there! You're looking at an example Jekyll project built by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). It's a simple site built to show folks how to use Sass with Jekyll. It's open sourced under the MIT license and can be download from [the GitHub project](https://github.com/mdo/jekyll-example).

For more information, read the [Using Sass with Jekyll](http://markdotto.com/2014/09/25/sass-and-jekyll/) post.
